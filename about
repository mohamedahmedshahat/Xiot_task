what i have learned:
it's the first time i have built a project from scratch so i have faced some problems and learned from it,
the problems i have faced relevant to building process and IDE configuration of the platform you'll work on,
but the concepts covered in this project i have learnt it before and tried some projects in embedded systems
shape the world course on Edx platform so iam considered familiar with this concepts of the application, also
i may be considered excellent in C programming as i have an experience before in programming through student 
activity in college, i have participated in international programming competition(ACM) as java developer.
finally as i mentioned in my application to this internship that iam in a need to practical side and that 
what i have touched in this Task, so i hope i get the chance to be apart of it so i can enhance my skills.
